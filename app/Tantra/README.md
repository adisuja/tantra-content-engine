# The Tantra layer

Everything Tantra adds to TryPost lives here, in `database/migrations/tantra/`, `resources/js/pages/tantra/`, `resources/js/components/tantra/`, `lang/*/tantra.php` and `tests/Feature/Tantra/`. The design is the PRD in `adisuja/tantra-content` at `docs/designs/tantra-content-engine.md`. `TantraServiceProvider` wires it all in: routes, commands, schedules, listeners and shared props.

## Switches

| Config | Default | What it turns on |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `tantra.boost.enabled` | off | Team comments, reactions and the author's replies from teammates' own Unipile accounts when a post goes live, and AI threads for composer posts. Waits for Spike S6. |
| `tantra.autoreply.enabled` | off | The hourly templated reply to every comment on a giveaway post, and the DMs to send list. |
| `tantra.health.token` | unset | `GET /tantra/health` for a pinger. Unset, it answers 404. |

## Schedules

| Command | When | What |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `tantra:heartbeat` | every minute | the scheduler tick the health report checks |
| `tantra:heartbeat --media` | every 15 minutes | files missing from storage for posts due in a day |
| `tantra:manual-tasks` | every 5 minutes | X posts and personal polls: due, emailed, expired |
| `tantra:giveaway-replies` | hourly | giveaway auto replies (off by default) |
| `tantra:collect-metrics` | 06:00 and 18:00 UTC | post and page numbers |
| `tantra:reconnect-reminders` | 03:41 UTC | LinkedIn connections about to run out or dropped |

One-off commands: `tantra:create-owner`, `tantra:map-profile`, `tantra:invite`, `tantra:zernio-connect`, `tantra:team-accounts`, `tantra:health`.

## Upstream files we touch

Each change is small and marked `// tantra:` (or `<!-- tantra: -->`). After merging upstream TryPost, check each one still applies.

- Platforms: `app/Enums/SocialAccount/Platform.php`, `app/Enums/PostPlatform/ContentType.php`, `app/Jobs/PublishToSocialPlatform.php`, `app/Support/ThreadReplies.php`, `app/Services/Media/MediaOptimizer.php`, `app/Services/Social/ContentSanitizer.php`, `app/Services/Social/ConnectionVerifier.php`, `app/Http/Controllers/Auth/SocialConnectionController.php`, `app/Models/SocialAccount.php`, and on the front end `types/platform.ts`, `types/content-type.ts`, `types/network-options.ts`, `PlatformBrandIcon.vue`, `usePlatformLogo.ts`, `PlatformPreview.vue`, `lib/docs.ts`.
- Approval by the review owner (PRD 10.8): `app/Models/Traits/HasWorkspace.php`, `app/Models/Workspace.php` (approvers), `composables/useWorkspaceAbilities.ts`.
- Slots held by polls posted by hand: `app/Actions/Post/Queue/ListFreeQueueSlots.php`, `ReflowChannelQueue.php`, `ListTakenSlots.php` (a UNION, so it stays one query), `BuildQueueTimeline.php`, and the calendar strip in `BuildCalendarPageProps.php` and `pages/posts/Calendar.vue`.
- Review chips on post cards: `app/Http/Resources/App/PostCardResource.php`, `PostTimelineCard.vue`, `PostDetailsDialog.vue`, `types/publish.ts`.
- Navigation and branding: `AppSidebar.vue`, `AppLogo.vue`, `WorkspaceMenuContent.vue`, `auth/LegalLinks.vue`, `layouts/auth/AuthSplitLayout.vue`.
- MCP: the Tantra tools on `app/Mcp/Servers/TryPostServer.php`.
- Branding: `app/Services/Http/SafeHttpFetcher.php` (our user agent).
- Tooling: `.prettierignore` (the studio CSS, generated in tantra-content).
- Copy without a marker: the Zernio entries in `lang/*/posts.php` (16 locales).
- Tests that pin upstream lists: `tests/Unit/Enums/PlatformTest.php`, `tests/Browser/SidebarMenuTest.php`, `tests/Feature/Mcp/ToolAnnotationsTest.php`, `tests/Feature/Parity/McpAuthorizationParityTest.php`.

## Operations

Runbooks, the deploy task and the backup pinger are in `adisuja/tantra-ops` (`runbooks/`, `tasks/`, `.github/workflows/health.yml`).
